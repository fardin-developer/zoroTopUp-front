        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Termination</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zennova may at any time, under certain circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Account and/or access to the Product. Cause for such termination shall include: (a) violations of provisions hereof or any other policies or guidelines that are referenced herein and/or posted on the Product; (b) a request by you to cancel or terminate your Account; (c) a request and/or order from law enforcement, a judicial body, or other government agency; (d) where provision of the Product to you is or may become unlawful; (e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems; (f) your participation in fraudulent or illegal activities; or (g) failure to pay any fees owed by you in relation to the Product, provided that in the case of non-material breach, Zennova will be permitted to terminate only after giving you 30 days’ notice and only if you have not cured the breach within such 30-day period. Any such termination or suspension shall be made by Zennova in its sole discretion and Zennova will not be responsible to you or any third party for any damages that may result or arise out of such termination or suspension of your Account and/or access to the Product.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In addition, Zennova may terminate your Account upon 30 days’ prior notice via email to the address associated with your Account if (a) your Account has been inactive for one (1) year; or (b) there is a general discontinuance of the Product or any part thereof. Notice of general discontinuance of Product will be provided as set forth herein, unless it would not be reasonable to do so due to circumstances arising from legal, regulatory, or governmental action; to address user security, user privacy, or technical integrity concerns; to avoid disruptions to other users; or due to a natural disaster, a catastrophic event, war, or other similar occurrence outside of Zennova’s reasonable control.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Should you breach any of these Terms, Zennova shall have the exclusive sole and absolute right to terminate, discontinue, or withdraw the provision of the Product to you. In the event of a breach by you, Zennova reserves its right to pursue any remedy or relief in so far as permitted by law, which includes but is not limited to injunction, damages, and/or specific performance.
